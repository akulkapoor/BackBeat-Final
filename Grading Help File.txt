Grading Help FileNames: Akul Kapoor, Matt Powell-PalmAndrew ID’s: akulk, mpowellpRequired Elements:1. JavaScript/JQuery: All our code is implemented in Javascript.2. HTML – Just take a look at our HTML file and work should be evident. We’ve got unsorted lists, we source audio files, we use forms for searching, the works. Every line is an example line.3. CSS – Similarly, our application of CSS is pretty encompassing. An example of a nice smooth transition can be found around line 40, where we make our search bars extend and contract. And when you click on a picture from the list…. izz niiice, right?4. DOM Manipulation – We manipulate the DOM left and right, all throughout our js. An example can be found when we populate our list of Similar Artists by appending them to divs which we append to other divs. Example around line 425. 5. AJAX – Our most important/trickiest use of AJAX can be found in the accessing of our EchoNest API, around line 226.6. jQuery – jQuery is also used just about everywhere in the js file, and our media player is a jQuery plugin, jPlayer. Examples everywhere, try around line 80.7. jQuery Mobile – Our whole design is based on jQuery mobile and we only have one html file using the jQuery pages framework.

8. PhoneGap - We use PhoneGap to hide the fact that we are navigating to a webpage.

9. We use AJAX from the server side to update each user's liked bands and playlists.

10. Node Express - we use express to run our server and passport to authenticate with Facebook, as well as mongoose to access our database.

11. We use MongoDB to store our user data, such as their liked bands and saved playlists so they can be easily accessed.
